  <h2>Analysis</h2>
  <font color="black">
    <p>Over the past five years the top receivers in the NFL have been undoubtedly Antonio Brown and Julio Jones. A debate that has raged between pundits and fans alike as who is truly the best receiver in the NFL. To the left are the stats of each receiver over the past five years. Antonio has surpassed Jones in receptions every year as well as touchdowns. Also, Brown has won the yardage battle three of the last five years and losing by only 37 yards in what would two of the best receiving seasons any receivers have had in recent memory as they both eclipsed the 1,800 yards mark in a single season. In conclusion, based on statistics alone Antonio Brown is the superior receiver especially if wins and play off success are accounted for as Brown has a super bowl win while Jones does not.</p> </div>

<h2><font color="gold">Antonio Brown Career History</font></h2>
<p>Antonio Brown is a 29 year old reciever from Miami, Florida. He played his colege career at Central Michigan and was selected in the sixth round by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2010. He is not a physically dominant reciever as he checks in at only 5 ft 10 in and 185 lb, however he is well regarded as one of the hardest working players in the league. He also viewed as the best route runner in the league and has some of the top hands. Last year he set a Guiness World Record for most one handed catches in a minute. He has led the league receptions multiple times and is feared throughout the league. He is a flashy reciever often getting called for excesive celebration penalties but it does not seem to phase him as he always says "Business in boomin." Brown wears the number 84</p>
<h2><font color="red">Julio Jones Career History</font></h2>
<p>Julio Jones took a much different path to stardom. He was a sought after recruit out of High School in Alabama at 6 ft 3 in and 220lbs he was born to play football. After winning a BCS National Championship at the University of Alabama the Atlanta Falcons traded up to take him with the 6th overall pick in 2011. He has led the league in recieving once but has not had the playoff success that Brown has had as the Falcons blew a 28-3 lead to the Patriots in last years super bowl. Jones wears the number 11 for the Falcons. Jones has the size and leaping ability that Brown lacks but is not a top teir route runner. A more quite reciever than Brown with great hands he is without a doubt an elite reciever even if his stats do not match up with Browns over their respective careers.</p>
